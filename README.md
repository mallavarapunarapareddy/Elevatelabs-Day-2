This project is a part of my Data Analyst Internship assignment focused on Data Visualization and Storytelling using Power BI. The dataset used contains over 1,000 rows of sales transactions including information such as sales person, country, product, date of sale, revenue amount, and quantity shipped. The objective was to analyze this data and build an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights key insights and trends.

Using Power BI Desktop, I cleaned the data using Power Query (e.g., converting the amount column to numeric and formatting dates), and built several visuals such as KPI cards, bar charts for sales by country, column charts for top-performing salespeople, line charts for monthly sales trends, and donut charts for regional contribution. These visuals helped uncover important business insights such as which countries and products generate the most revenue, seasonal sales trends, and performance comparisons among salespersons.

The final deliverable includes the .pbix Power BI file along with a PDF export of the dashboard. This project enhanced my skills in data preparation, choosing the right charts, and delivering clear, impactful visual stories to support decision-making. All files and documentation are included in this repository.
